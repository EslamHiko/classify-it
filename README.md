# ClassifyIt
Facebook Group posts Classifier using category based words occurrences count algorithm built with [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) 
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/),[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) mainly for the Front-End and
 [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) [Express](https://expressjs.com/) mainly for the Back-End.

> Note: This project was built in 2 days [Facebook : For Social Good Hackathon](https://hackathon-devc-cairo.splashthat.com/).

> I didn't win üòî but the project still a good portfolio item üòÅ.

### The Algorithm Used for Classification
`backend/utils/scoreCalc.js`
```javascript
const getScore = async (text) =>{
  var score = {};
  if(text){
    posts = await getPosts();
    posts.forEach(post => {
      wordList = post.text.replace(/\s\s+/g, ' ').trim().split(" ");
      score[post.category] = score[post.category] ? score[post.category] : 0;
      wordList.forEach(word => {
        var regExp = new RegExp(word.toUpperCase(), "gi");
        var count = (text.toUpperCase().match(regExp) || []).length;
        score[post.category] += count;
      });
    })
  }
  return score;
}
```
> Note: If you want more accurate results you can use [BrainJS](https://github.com/BrainJS/brain.js) 
I came up with this algorithm because I was in a hurry and my machine wasn't really helping üòÖ, 
but the results would be 80%+ the same I think.

This returns the score array we can see in the final object here

This object is equal to this

Here we see that this post has 1 word occurence in each of the 3 categories `prayer, help request, medical inquery`

If the post has more words that are in a single category wordlist it'll show only this category.

### What can the user do ?
- CRUD operations for Categories

- CRUD operations for Category Wordlists

- CRUD operations for Posts in case you wanted to take notes,follow up on a particular post

### What you can learn from the code : 

- CRUD Operations
- Social Login with React, Next.js and Express
- Including Bootstrap in your Next.js project
- Using SSL HTTPS for local development
- Working With FB Groups API or External APIs.

### How to run the project
`git clone https://github.com/EslamHiko/classify-it.git`

#### Set Your Settings
`backend/config/config.js`
```javascript
const config = {
  MongoURI : "YOUR_FB_MONGODB_URL",

- `cd backend`
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`

#### Run the Front-End Server (https://localhost:3000)
- `cd frontend`
